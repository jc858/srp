	About the project
</h3>    
<p>
RNA sequencing provides insight into transcriptomes of a single cell or nuclei and as a result allows us to understand the functional elements of a genome. Analysis of gene expressions might reveal a novel gene as well as an association between a specific feature and disease risk, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease. One of the crucial steps in RNA-seq is a bioinformatics approach, which includes reference genome mapping and differential gene expression test. Nowadays, RNA-seq techniques evolve rapidly giving more possibilities for analysis. Therefore, due to numerous pipelines, re-analysis of data without proper documentation is challenging. Here, we present our attempt to re-analyse the dataset from Smajic et al. (2020).

We showed that using the approach described by authors it is impossible to obtain alike conclusions without the completed information and data. Moreover, we described numerous obstacles, which we encountered and how we attempted to resolve them. We presented that re-analysis of the targeted dataset and deriving a similar conclusion is possible with the Loupe Browser application. We showed, similarly to Smajic et al. 2020, that microglia and astrocytes are associated with the risk of PD. To present a summary of performed analysis, we created a website. The website was used as a means to present the figures and data generated during the analyses, with a page dedicated to each approach, and another page to allow a user to search for information about specific genes.
