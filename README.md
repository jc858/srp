# srp

This is a website designed to present data from a re-analysis of another paper. The paper and associated references can be found in srpref.html.

The website includes a gene search function, which requires the output from the analysis in tsv format to be added to a MySQL database and the details of the database to be added to a search.ini file. This file has been omitted from the respository for the sake of security.
